    [*] --> Operational : System running under normal parameters

    Operational --> Degraded_FallbackActive : System detects issue, activates a FallbackPolicy
    Degraded_FallbackActive --> Operational : Issue resolved, fallback policy deactivated, normal operations resume
    Degraded_FallbackActive --> Degraded_FallbackActive : Fallback policy conditions persist or new one activated
    
    Operational --> MaintenanceMode : System intentionally put into maintenance
    MaintenanceMode --> Operational : Maintenance complete, system back online
    MaintenanceMode --> Degraded_FallbackActive : Issue during maintenance forces fallback

    Degraded_FallbackActive --> EmergencyMode : Critical failure, system escalates to EmergencyMode policy
    Operational --> EmergencyMode : Sudden critical failure

    EmergencyMode --> Degraded_FallbackActive : Emergency contained, system moves to a less critical fallback
    EmergencyMode --> MaintenanceMode : Emergency handled, system requires maintenance before full operation
    EmergencyMode --> Operational : Full recovery from emergency (less likely direct path)

    note left of Degraded_FallbackActive
        One or more FallbackPolicy
        from System Configuration
        is active. E.g., ANPR down,
        using manual entry.
        VisitReconciliationJobs
        may be created.
    end note
    
    note right of EmergencyMode
        EmergencyMode policy from
        System Configuration is active.
        E.g., Fire alarm, security threat.
        May involve all gates open,
        no charges, etc.
    end note
