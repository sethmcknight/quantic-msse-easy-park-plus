    %% Linking Operational and Billing states (Conceptual)
    %% This is hard to show perfectly in Mermaid for parallel states that are not time-synchronized
    %% but conceptually:
    %% ExitedLot (Operational) often triggers final billing actions if not already paid.
    %% PaymentConfirmed (Billing) can influence ExitedLot (Operational) if exit is gated by payment.
    %% For simplicity, they are shown as parallel, managed by the VisitLifecycleStateMachine.
