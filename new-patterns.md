# Anti-Patterns Removed and New Patterns Implemented

## Anti-Patterns Removed

### 1. Magic Numbers
- **Original Issue**: Use of -1 to represent empty slots
- **Solution**: Implemented State Pattern for slot states
- **Benefit**: Clear state representation and type safety
- **Impact**: Improved code readability and reduced potential for errors

### 2. UI-Business Logic Coupling
- **Original Issue**: Direct UI manipulation from business logic
- **Solution**: Implemented Observer Pattern
- **Benefit**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Impact**: Easier to maintain and modify UI independently

### 3. Hard-Coded Behavior
- **Original Issue**: Fixed slot behavior and vehicle types
- **Solution**: Implemented State Pattern and Factory Pattern
- **Benefit**: Flexible slot behavior and vehicle creation
- **Impact**: System can easily accommodate new vehicle types and slot behaviors

### 4. Direct Operation Execution
- **Original Issue**: Direct method calls for operations
- **Solution**: Implemented Command Pattern
- **Benefit**: Encapsulated operations with undo/redo support
- **Impact**: Added ability to track and reverse operations

### 5. Multiple Parking Lot Instances
- **Original Issue**: Multiple parking lot instances causing state inconsistency
- **Solution**: Implemented Singleton Pattern
- **Benefit**: Single source of truth for parking lot state
- **Impact**: Consistent state management across the application

### 6. Legacy Code Incompatibility
- **Original Issue**: Direct use of old method names and structures
- **Solution**: Implemented Adapter Pattern
- **Benefit**: Backward compatibility with legacy code
- **Impact**: Easier integration with existing systems

### 7. Complex Level Management
- **Original Issue**: Direct level handling with complex logic
- **Solution**: Implemented Composite Pattern
- **Benefit**: Uniform level operations
- **Impact**: Simplified multi-level parking lot management

## New Patterns Implemented

### 1. State Pattern
- **Purpose**: Manage parking slot states
- **Components**: 
  - `ParkingSlotState` interface
  - Concrete states: `EmptyState`, `OccupiedState`, `ReservedState`
- **Value Added**:
  - Clear representation of slot states
  - Encapsulated state-specific behavior
  - Easy to add new states
  - Type-safe state transitions

### 2. Observer Pattern
- **Purpose**: Decouple UI from business logic
- **Components**:
  - `ParkingLotObserver` interface
  - `ParkingLotUI` as concrete observer
- **Value Added**:
  - Loose coupling between UI and business logic
  - Real-time updates to UI
  - Multiple observers can be added easily
  - Easier testing and maintenance

### 3. Command Pattern
- **Purpose**: Encapsulate parking operations
- **Components**:
  - `Command` interface
  - Concrete commands: `CreateParkingLotCommand`, `ParkCommand`, `LeaveCommand`
- **Value Added**:
  - Operation history tracking
  - Undo/redo capability
  - Encapsulated operation logic
  - Easy to add new operations

### 4. Singleton Pattern
- **Purpose**: Ensure single parking lot instance
- **Components**:
  - Private constructor
  - Static instance method
- **Value Added**:
  - Guaranteed single instance
  - Global access point
  - Consistent state management
  - Resource optimization

### 5. Adapter Pattern
- **Purpose**: Handle legacy code compatibility
- **Components**:
  - `LegacyParkingLotAdapter`
- **Value Added**:
  - Backward compatibility
  - Gradual migration path
  - Clean interface for new code
  - Reduced technical debt

### 6. Composite Pattern
- **Purpose**: Handle multi-level parking lots
- **Components**:
  - `ParkingLotComponent` interface
  - `MultiLevelParkingLot` and `SingleLevelParkingLot`
- **Value Added**:
  - Uniform handling of levels
  - Simplified level management
  - Easy to add new levels
  - Consistent operations across levels

### 7. Factory Pattern
- **Purpose**: Create vehicles
- **Components**:
  - `VehicleFactory`
- **Value Added**:
  - Centralized vehicle creation
  - Easy to add new vehicle types
  - Encapsulated creation logic
  - Reduced code duplication
