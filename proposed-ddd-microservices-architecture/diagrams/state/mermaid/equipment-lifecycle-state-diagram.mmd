    [*] --> Installed : Equipment installed and configured

    Installed --> Operational : Equipment passes initial testing
    Installed --> Failed_Installation : Installation testing fails

    Operational --> UnderMaintenance : Scheduled or emergency maintenance
    Operational --> Faulted : Equipment fault detected
    Operational --> Offline : Communication lost or power failure
    Operational --> Retired : Equipment end-of-life

    UnderMaintenance --> Operational : Maintenance complete, equipment restored
    UnderMaintenance --> Faulted : Maintenance reveals faults requiring repair
    UnderMaintenance --> Retired : Maintenance determines equipment beyond repair

    Faulted --> UnderMaintenance : Fault requires maintenance intervention
    Faulted --> Operational : Fault self-resolved or remotely fixed
    Faulted --> Offline : Fault causes equipment to go offline
    Faulted --> Retired : Fault irreparable, equipment retired

    Offline --> Operational : Communication/power restored, equipment functional
    Offline --> Faulted : Offline due to equipment fault
    Offline --> UnderMaintenance : Offline requires maintenance intervention
    Offline --> Retired : Equipment unable to be restored

    Retired --> [*]
    Failed_Installation --> [*]

    note right of Operational
        Equipment fully functional and available:
        - Gates: ANPR working, barrier operational
        - Chargers: Available for charging sessions
        - Sensors: Providing accurate data
        Triggers EquipmentItemStatusChanged events
    end note
    
    note right of UnderMaintenance
        Equipment temporarily unavailable:
        - Scheduled maintenance windows
        - Emergency repairs
        - Software updates
        - Safety inspections
    end note
    
    note right of Faulted
        Equipment fault detected:
        - Hardware malfunction
        - Software errors
        - Safety violations
        - Performance degradation
        Triggers fault events to Incident & Enforcement
    end note
    
    note right of Offline
        Equipment unreachable:
        - Network connectivity issues
        - Power failures
        - Communication hardware faults
        - Security system isolation
    end note
