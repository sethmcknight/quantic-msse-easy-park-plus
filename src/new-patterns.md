# Design Patterns and Improvements

## 1. Command Pattern
- Implemented for parking and lot creation operations
- Allows for undo/redo functionality
- Encapsulates operation parameters
- Supports both specific lot/level parking and general parking

## 2. Observer Pattern
- Implemented for real-time UI updates
- ParkingLot maintains a list of observers
- UI registers as an observer to receive updates
- Notifications sent for all major state changes
- Decouples parking lot state from UI updates

## 3. Factory Pattern
- VehicleFactory centralizes vehicle creation
- Supports multiple vehicle types:
  - Regular vehicles (Car, Truck, Motorcycle, Bus)
  - Electric vehicles (ElectricCar, ElectricMotorcycle)
- Encapsulates vehicle creation logic
- Makes adding new vehicle types easier

## 4. State Pattern
- Manages parking slot states (Empty/Occupied)
- Encapsulates slot behavior based on state
- Makes slot state transitions explicit and maintainable

## 5. Composite Pattern
- Hierarchical structure for parking lots
- ParkingLotLevel as composite component
- Supports nested levels and slots
- Makes lot management more flexible

## 6. Singleton Pattern
- ParkingLot implemented as a singleton
- Ensures single instance across application
- Thread-safe initialization
- Global access to parking lot state
- Maintains consistent state

## 7. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- VehicleData for vehicle information
- ParkingLotData for lot configuration
- SearchCriteria for search operations
- Clean separation of data and behavior
- Type-safe data transfer

## 8. UI Improvements
- Tabbed interface for better organization
- Lot and level selection in vehicle operations
- Detailed lot information display
- Real-time updates through observer pattern
- Improved error handling and user feedback

## 9. Error Handling
- Input validation at UI level
- Proper error messages
- Exception handling for robustness
- User-friendly error display
- Logging for debugging

## 10. Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular design
- Type hints for better maintainability
- Consistent naming conventions
- Well-documented code

## 11. Recent Improvements
- Added lot and level selection for parking
- Enhanced parking slot management
- Improved UI feedback
- Better error handling
- More detailed status reporting

## 12. Future Considerations
- Add persistence layer
- Support for multiple parking lots
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Real-time statistics and reporting
- Additional vehicle types
